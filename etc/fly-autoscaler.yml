# This expression determines the number of machines to maintain in your app
# after each reconciliation. If the number of machines drops below this
# threshold then more will be created by cloning one of the existing machines.
# If the number of machines is above this threshold then some machines will be
# destroyed.

# There always needs to be at least one machine in your application so the 
# autoscaler will never destroy your last machine, even if the threshold reaches
# zero.

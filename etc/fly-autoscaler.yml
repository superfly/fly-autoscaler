# This expression determines the number of machines to maintain in a "started"
# state after each reconciliation. If the number of started machines is less
# existing machines will be started. If the number of started machines is more
# then running machines will be stopped.

# You can also define separate minimum & maximum thresholds using the
# "min_started_machine_count" & "max_started_machine_count" fields.

# Metric collectors fetch the current metrics when a reconciliation is performed.

# They store the current value locally with a given metric name so that the
